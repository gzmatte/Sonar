### If you use Sonar, you notice that you can't disable the sonar outputs in app, and if you only use this for the microphone, it's frustrating. So Enjoy.

★ Once Sonar starts, use the bat. It will automatically disable additional playback outputs.

### ★ [Download here](https://github.com/gzmatte/sonar/releases/download/1/Sonar.bat)

Default Sound output wrong? 
> Edit the batch file and Ualá!

```
:: Replace "Speakers" with your Default Sound Device Name.

SoundVolumeView.exe /SetDefault "Speakers"
```

NOT WORKING?
EDIT THE BAT AND CHANGE THE NAME OF ALL THE OUTPUTS.
