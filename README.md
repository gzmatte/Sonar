If you use Sonar, you notice that u can't turn off sonar outputs, and if u only use this for the microphone, its frustrating. So, enjoy.

> (Install Sonar and configurate mic first.)

Open the bat after start sonar. It will automatically disable additional playback outputs.
>  (Cause we only want the microphone).
